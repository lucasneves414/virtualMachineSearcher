VIRTUAL MACHINE SEARCHER

An app that searches for Virtual Machines bringing the best cost-effectiveness, the most expensive and the medium price among all.



## Deployment

To run this project, download it, go to the virtualMachineSearcher folder and open the file index.html on your browser. That is all.


## Documentation


Bellow are the instruction and requirements sent by the company team for it's construction.

Developer Test: Virtual Machine (VM) Cost Calculator
Context: At Contoso office, a buzz of activity echoed the company's growth in the digital
space. Their IT systems were expanding fast, especially with new digital tools being
added regularly. The company decided to use Virtual Machines (VMs) for some parts of
their system. But there was a catch: before setting up these VMs, the top management
wanted to make sure they were choosing the most cost-effective options. They didn't
want to waste money on unnecessary resources.
This meant the IT team had a task at hand. They had to find a way to choose VM
configurations that gave the best value for money. They needed a system that ensured
they got the power they needed without overspending.
You as a developer was requested to develop a web app using Contoso main stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jinja.

Develop a Web App
Objective: Develop a web app that allows users to submit their VM requirements and
returns the VM sizes that fulfills the minimum requirements at the least cost.
Scenario & Background:
o VM refers to Virtual Machine.
o Size indicates the configuration specifications of the VM.
o Assume the backend has processed all the necessary data for you, and your
primary role is to interface this data through a user-friendly front-end application.
Requirements:
1. Create a form:
1.1. User Input: The users can input the following VM requirements:
o RAM (in GB)
o vCPU cores
o Operating System (OS: Linux, Windows)
1.2. Display Results: Once the user submits their requirements, the page should:
1.2.1. Based on the user's input, display the VM sizes that fulfills the minimum
requirements at the least cost.

2. Create an overview that displays:
2.1. The most cost-effective VM in the base.
2.2. The most expensive VM in the base.
2.3. The medium VMs price.
Example Inputs:
â€¢ RAM: 15 GB
â€¢ vCPU cores: 4
â€¢ OS: Linux

UI/UX: The UI/UX design should be pleasant, and practical.

Backend Integration:
o This test focuses on the front-end part of the application.
o You will receive a CSV file with the VMs lists with sizes and their costs. Your
interface should ensure the displayed results align with this CSV data. Choose the
best way to include this data into you web page.
o You can change the file format, if needed.
Notes:
o VM sizes without a price are unavailable.
o "meterName" or "armSkuName" are used to represent the VM Size names.
o "unitPricePerUnit" indicates the hourly cost of the VM Size.
